# mapping_nyc
I use folium and plotly to practice mapping capabilities on python

Libraries used:
seaborn for regression plotting to gauge surviving licenses over time,
wordcloud to illustrate common words used in restaurant naming convention,
plotly to load a choropleth map to illustrate the zipcodes with most licenses,
folium to plot most recent liquor licenses received
